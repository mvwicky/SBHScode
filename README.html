<h1>SBHS CODE</h1>
<div class="container">
	This is the library for and by the SBHS Robotics Club.
	<br>
	This library is based on the Norman Advanced Robotics OpenCode library. 
	<br>
	The two files follow what are fairly drastically different coding methodologies. 
	<h4><u>CBC CLASS</h4></u>
	The CBC class file defines a class called cbc. Two cbc instances are called by default called lego and create. 
	<br>
	Obivously, the lego instance is used to control the CBC connected to the lego bot and the create instance is used to control the cbc connected to the create.
	<br>
	The cbc class has multiple structures that control different states of the bot. 
	<br>
	<div class="struct">Structures</div>
	<br>
		<div class="struct">drive_motors:</div> 
			<div class="structPop">This structure contains the states of the motors that make the robot move around. Generally only used for the robot used in the lego bot because the create has its own drive motors. Initialized by default are left and right.
	<br>		
			includes: 
	<br>
			----port: the number port the drive motor is in. 
	<br>
			----radius_to_middle: one half the distance between the drive motors (wheels)
	<br>
			----ticks: amount of ticks in one revolution of the wheel. Nominally (or normally) 1000
	<br>	
			----diameter: diameter of the wheel attatched to the motor</div>
	
		<div class="struct">gen_motor:</div> 
			<div class="structPop">This structure contains the states of the motors that do not make the robot move around, eg arms, levers, massive cranes. Normally used for both bots. Initialized by default are motors called gen[i] where i is the index of the motor.
	<br>
			includes:
	<br>
			----port: the number port that the motor is in.
	<br>
			----ticks: amount of ticks in one revolution of the wheel. (1000)
	<br>
			----diameter: diameter of the wheel attatched to the motor</div>
