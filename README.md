Some Notes:
Make sure to include the distance macros at the beginning of all files that use the create.
like this:
"#define DIST100(x) ( ( (.952847 * x) - 26.9) : (x) )\n"
"#define DIST200(x) ( ( (.971316 * x) - 5.06716) : (x) )\n"
"#define DIST300\n"
"#define DIST500\n"
"#define DIST600\n"
"#define DIST700\n"
"#define DIST800\n"
